## AI Agents Infrastructure for Web3

OpenGraph provides infrastructure products for AI Agents in the blockchain ecosystem. Built on the Sui blockchain, we aim to seamlessly onboard all AI Agents and ML models into a fully onchain environment.

### Vision

OpenGraph bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and Web3, building infrastructure that enables AI agents to operate autonomously within blockchain ecosystems. Our vision is to create a world where AI agents can autonomously operate, learn, and evolve within a fully onchain environment.

### Core Technology

- **Sui Blockchain Integration**: Built on Sui's high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, providing scalability and security for AI operations
